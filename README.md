# Robot
Java Robot covering the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). The robot can travel and either cleans or dirties a cell.  

WARNING: All of the code provided is in french. 

Consider the following, a World is created and consists of a two-dimensional matrix of cells.
Different kind of robots operate in this world:
- Polluting Robots
- Cleaning Robots

The polluting robots travel across the matrix and make a cell "dirty". Meanwhile, the cleaning robots immediately remove the dirt from the cell they're in.

Polluting robots are either Skippy Robots or Straight Robots, meaning they either skip a cell at a time or continue in a straight line.

The cleaning robots travel the matrix as such: they start at the first line and travel the world cell by cell. Once they arrive at the last cell, they go down a line and travel the world in the opposite direction, kind of like how you would in a Snake game on Nokia phones.
